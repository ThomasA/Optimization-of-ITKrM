The quickest way to numba-fy somthing is as follows


from numba import jit

@jit
def some_function(x,y,z):
	stuf
	stuf
	stuf
	return some stuf




Remember to do some testing of the time it takes to run, as numba is not guranteed to be faster.

Also, first time numba runs it has some overhead, as it while try an compiled the optimized code in the first run of a given function

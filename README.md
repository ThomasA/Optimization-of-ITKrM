# Optimization of ITKrM
This repository contains various implementations of the dictionary learning algorithm ITKrM, as [defined by Karin Schnass](https://www.uibk.ac.at/mathematik/personal/schnass/papers/15_sc_itkms_2.pdf) [1]

## Current state

The files within ['code'](https://github.com/ThomasA/Optimization-of-ITKrM/tree/master/code) are all the code files made throughout a semester project of a group of students I supervised in the spring of 2018.

The files within ['project_code'](https://github.com/ThomasA/Optimization-of-ITKrM/tree/master/project_code) are all the code files used for testing throughout the project, cleaner, though very specific code.

This is all the work of my students: Amalie Vistoft Petersen, Jacob Theilgaard Lassen, Niels Rymann Munthe, and Sebastian Biegel Schi√∏ler. I am merely tidying it up a bit.

## Road map

The plan is to convert the collection of Python code in this repository to a coherent package that can easily be used by other. This may take some time... Stay tuned to follow the progress.

Each folder contains the files necessary to run the different tests made in the appendix.
In each appendix in the report some files are named.
Besides the files mentioned in the report there are some other files that help load and format data, but were not named in the report.
This because they are simple help files that do not affect the measured execution time, memory usage and such.

The file that should be run for each tests is the file defined as "Main" in the report.
The rest of the files in the folders are simply used by the "Main"

The E folder has a file for plotting, where the data is hardcoded into it.
The G folder has 2 files, these are both the "Main" file.
